- 2008.09 ~ 2012.07 **Hebei University of Technology**, B.S. in Information Management

## Work Experiences

### Full Time

1. 2015.03 ~ Now **JD Finance**, Algorithm Engineer

### Intern

1. 2013.11 ~ 2014.02 **Founder International Co., Ltd.**, Algorithm Engineer

## Project Experiences

### Daat (Complex Network & Knowledge Graph)

2018.04 ~ Now **JD Finance** Project Leader

- **JD Finance Knowledge Graph Technical White Paper**：Investigate the entire Knowledge Graph technology stack, including realted models, data, evaluation reports and open source tools, and summarize the final research report.
- **Automatic Sensitive Information Identification**：Automatic sensitive information identification for data stored in the data warehouse, assisted with data encryption policy implementation. The model is constructed using the Wide & Deep network based on the meta-information of the data (e.g., table name, table comment, column name, column comment, etc.) and value-information of the data (e.g., the data values of every column). Build the Wide network with extracted traditional features and the Deep network with text features using Char Embeddding + CNN, and the F1-Score on test data is 95%+.

### All Seeing Eyes (Chinese Address Analytics)

2015.03 ~ 2018.04 **JD Finance** Project Leader

- Development of **Chinese address analytics algorithms**, including: segmentataion, classification, integrity, POI identification and similarity **(accuracy 90%+)**.
- Development of **Address Profile System** based on the basic algorithm engine. It increased the conversion rate of users by 30%+ in the offline payment service.
- Development of the anti-fraud and credit model based on the Chinese address analysis system. The anti-fraud model identified illegal encashment orders with **200,000 yuan/day**, and more than **10 million users** were granted credit with the credit model.
- This project has beed awarded the **"Innovation Seed" prize** of JingYa Cup innovation competition in JD.com ranking **20 of 378**.
- Development of **Enterprise Address Profile System** based on the basic algorithm engine which was embeeded into [**JD Enterprise Credit**](https://icredit.jd.com/).
- Development of **Rural Finance Service Station Location Solution** base on the Address Profile System.

### User Behavior Analytics

2017.10 ~ 2017.12 **JD Finance** Algorithms Engineer

- Development of a user behavior representation method named on Behavior2Vec. Based on hierarchical clustering and depth search, a hybrid model for identifying user abnormal behavior is proposed. Compared with Bag of Words and N-GRAM methods, the number of abnormal users identified is **3+ times** of traditional methods.

### Mortgage Loan

2015.03 ~ 2015.10 **JD Finance** Algorithms Engineer

- Development of a hybird product life cycle identifacation model based on Bass Diffusion model, optimized time series similarity method and clustring method. It got an **accuracy of 95%+** when identifing the excess inventory products, which helped to make loans goods pledge decisions and calculate the loan-to-value ratio.
- Development of product information fusion model and system with ElasticSearch which got **90%+ recognition accuracy** and provided accurate and relevant information, such as price, etc.

### Smart Public Security (EzMap)

2013.11 ~ 2014.02 **Founder International Co., Ltd.** Algorithms Engineer

- Development of a series prediction algorithm based on EMD and SVR for crime analysis and time series prediction in smart city project.
- Development of a serial crime cases identifacation algorithm based on k-Prototypes.
- Development of public security metadata import tools and XML based police GIS database upgrade tools.
